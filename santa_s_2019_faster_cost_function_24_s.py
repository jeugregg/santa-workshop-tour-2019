# About this kernel

The `cost_function` in this kernel is roughly 600x faster compared to the original kernel. 
Each function call takes roughly 24 Âµs.

## Quick Start

1. Import this utility file: File > Add utility script > Search Notebooks > *Type this notebook name*

2. Copy the code below to get started:
```
# Imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# The name of the kernel might change, so update this if needed
from santa_s_2019_faster_cost_function_24_s import build_cost_function

# Load Data
base_path = '/kaggle/input/santa-workshop-tour-2019/'
data = pd.read_csv(base_path + 'family_data.csv', index_col='family_id')
submission = pd.read_csv(base_path + 'sample_submission.csv', index_col='family_id')

# Build your "cost_function"
cost_function = build_cost_function(data)

# Run it on default submission file
best = submission['assigned_day'].values
start_score = cost_function(best)
```

A longer example is provided at the end.


## Note

Starting in V12, I decided to make this an utility script instead of a regular notebook.
I think this is a better use of this kernel, since you can now directly import this into
your project and use it just like an API, instead of copy-pasting the lengthy code.

I think that make this into a script forces me to keep the code cleaner.

## Reference

* (Excellent) Original Kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/inversion/santa-s-2019-starter-notebook
* First kernel that had the idea to use Numba: https://www.kaggle.com/nickel/250x-faster-cost-function-with-numba-jit
* Another great cost function optimization: https://www.kaggle.com/sekrier/fast-scoring-using-c-52-usec
* More modular output for intermediate function: https://www.kaggle.com/nickel/santa-s-2019-fast-pythonic-cost-23-s
